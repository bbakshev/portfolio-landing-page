  <p>A brief summary of me and my projects at Epicodus.</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Brishna, most people call me Bri. I live in Seattle, WA with my best friend. I studied abroad in London for my Master of Business Administration, I absolutely loved living in London! Before joining Epicodus, I worked for DoorDash as a Team Lead for Grocery and Convenience catalog creation. I joined Epicodus to learn something new and something demanding. My goal is to have a job that is fun and secure.</p>
