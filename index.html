  <p>A brief summary of me and my projects at Epicodus.</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Brishna, most people call me Bri. I live in Seattle, WA with my best friend. I studied abroad in London for my Master of Business Administration, I absolutely loved living in London! Before joining Epicodus, I worked for DoorDash as a Team Lead for Grocery and Convenience catalog creation. I joined Epicodus to learn something new and something demanding. My goal is to have a job that is fun and secure.</p>
  <h4>My current hobbies as follows in no particular order:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing Video Games</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Traveling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am absolutely in love with film photography. I try to take as many film shots as I can. One of my favorite site to get inspiration from is called <a href="https://filmphotographyproject.com/">The Film Project.</a></p>
